 * Sum square difference
 * Problem 6
 * The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * 1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385
 *
 * The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
 * (1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025
 *
 * Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural 
 * numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 âˆ’ 385 = 2640.
 * 
 * Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred 
 * natural numbers and the square of the sum.

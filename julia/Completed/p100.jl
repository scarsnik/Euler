# Arranged probability
# Problem 100
# If a box contains twenty-one coloured discs, composed of fifteen blue discs 
# and six red discs, and two discs were taken at random, it can be seen that 
# the probability of taking two blue discs, P(BB) = (15/21)Ã—(14/20) = 1/2.

# The next such arrangement, for which there is exactly 50% chance of taking 
# two blue discs at random, is a box containing eighty-five blue discs and 
# thirty-five red discs.

# By finding the first arrangement to contain over 10^12 = 1,000,000,000,000 
# discs in total, determine the number of blue discs that the box would contain.

disc(b::BigFloat) = (1+sqrt(1+4(2b*b-2b)))/2
blue(n::BigFloat) = (1+sqrt(1+2n*(n-1)))/2
check(n::BigFloat, b::BigFloat) = b/n*(b-1)/(n-1) == 1/2
